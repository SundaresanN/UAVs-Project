Project UAVs Description

Fundamental server side libraries:

- dronekit api for python: this module is essential in order to communicate with 3dr drone
- eventlet: this module is used to handle threads that will run server side everytime client will send request
- flask: this module is used in order to build a server side using Python language
- flask-socketio: this module is used to communicate realtime (using sockets) with client from server

Server Side Communication Solution:
One of the biggest problem of this system is proper drone WiFi network, in fact every drone generates a WiFi network and to communicate with it I need to be connected to this WiFi network. Our system is thought in order to handle multiple drones and it means that I need to be connected to each drone with a single WiFi antenna.
First attempt of solution to this problem was switching WiFi network everytime I need to send command to a particular drone. This solution is not feasible because slow nature of WiFi switching that causes delay in each action that drone has to do.
Second attempt of solution is the following one:
- Each object of the system (drone or camera) has been associated with a particular antenna ==> if we have 2 drones with 2 cameras I will have 4 antenna connected on laptop.
- I will use network interface and not anymore WiFi switch, this seems like something not perfect but obviusly is more fast than the other solution

How to hanlde all the interfaces with associated objects?

1) I can check how many drones I have in the network -> to allow this research I need that Drone WiFi Network is like: Solo(ColorDrone)Drone. This kind of name because I need regular expression in order to detect Drone on my network:
